        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="indent-8">
        Hello, I am Cynthia Brito-Mena, a Full-Stack Software Engineer and
        recent graduate of Fullstack Academy's Future Code Fellowship program.
        Before joining Fullstack Academy, I worked in the non-profit space for
        over six years. Over that period, I worked in volunteer management
        developing and implementing volunteer programs serving youth across the
        country, as well as recruiting and training volunteers to lead those
        programs. Most recently, I worked in the education space as the site
        supervisor for an after-school and day camp program working with youth
        experiencing homelessness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="indent-8">
        As a native New Yorker and recent graduate, I am excited to explore
        opportunities that allow me to create and support web applications that
        empower youth and directly impact the lives of NYC residents..
